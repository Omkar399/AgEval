    "response": "Okay, I'm ready to help you complete Project 3. To give you the best assistance, I need some information about the project. Please tell me:\n\n**1. What is the topic or objective of Project 3?**  (e.g., a website, a data analysis project, a game, a mobile app, a research paper, etc.)  The more detail you can provide here, the better.  For example:\n    *   \"Project 3 is a simple to-do list web application.\"\n    *   \"Project 3 is a data analysis project on customer churn, predicting which customers are likely to leave.\"\n    *   \"Project 3 is a basic text-based adventure game.\"\n\n**2. What are the specific requirements or deliverables of the project?**  (e.g., what features must the application have, what data needs to be analyzed, what are the game's rules, etc.)  This is crucial.  Break it down if possible.  For example:\n    *   For the to-do list: \"Users should be able to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them.  The tasks should be stored in local storage.\"\n    *   For the churn analysis: \"The project needs to load a CSV dataset, perform data cleaning, build a machine learning model to predict churn, and then evaluate the model's performance.\"\n    *   For the adventure game: \"The player starts in a forest, can move north, south, east, or west, and must find a key to unlock a treasure chest.\"\n\n**3. What technologies or tools are you expected to use?** (e.g., Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, SQL, etc.)  This will help me tailor the code or advice I provide.\n\n**4. What stage are you at in the project?**  (e.g., just starting, have some code written, struggling with a specific part, etc.)\n\n**5. Do you have any existing code or any starting point?** If so, please provide it or a link to it. This is extremely helpful.\n\n**6. What are your goals for this project?** (e.g., to learn a new technology, to build a portfolio piece, to solve a specific problem)\n\n**Once I have this information, I can help you with:**\n\n*   **Planning and Design:**  Breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks.\n*   **Code Snippets and Examples:**  Providing code in the appropriate language for specific features or functionalities.\n*   **Debugging:**  Helping you identify and fix errors in your code.\n*   **Code Reviews:**  Suggesting improvements to your code's structure, style, and efficiency.\n*   **Testing:**  Helping you create and run tests to ensure your project works correctly.\n*   **Research:**  Finding relevant documentation, tutorials, and libraries.\n*   **Problem-solving:**  Brainstorming solutions to challenges you encounter.\n*   **Explaining Concepts:**  Clarifying any confusing concepts related to your project.\n\n**Example Scenario (Let's imagine a project):**\n\nLet's say you tell me:\n\n\"Project 3 is a simple to-do list web application.  It should allow users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them. The tasks should be stored in local storage. I'm using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm just starting.\"\n\nIn that case, I could help you by:\n\n1.  **Planning:**  Suggesting a basic HTML structure for the page (input field, add button, task list).\n2.  **Code Snippets:**  Providing JavaScript code to add tasks, mark them complete, delete them, and save/load them from local storage.\n3.  **CSS:**  Suggesting CSS to style the to-do list.\n4.  **Debugging:** Helping troubleshoot any JavaScript errors.\n5.  **Guidance:** Suggesting resources to learn more about the technologies.\n\n**So, please provide the information about your Project 3, and let's get started!**\n",
