    "prompt": "Find five recent academic papers on CRISPR applications in agriculture (you may assume citations are known). Extract each paper's title and abstract. Write a 200-word summary that cites each title at least once.",
    "response": "I do not have access to real-time information, including academic databases like PubMed or Web of Science. Therefore, I cannot provide you with five recent academic papers on CRISPR applications in agriculture and their abstracts.  To find these papers, I recommend searching databases like these using keywords such as \"CRISPR,\" \"gene editing,\" \"agriculture,\" \"crops,\" and specific crop names (e.g., \"rice,\" \"wheat,\" \"soybean\").\n\nHowever, I can give you a *hypothetical* example of how such a summary might look, assuming I had access to the papers.  Replace the placeholder titles and abstracts with actual information you find in your search.\n\n\n**Hypothetical Summary:**\n\nRecent advancements in CRISPR-Cas technology have revolutionized agricultural biotechnology.  Several studies highlight its potential for improving crop yields and resilience. For example, \"Enhanced Drought Tolerance in Maize Using CRISPR-Cas9\" demonstrated successful modification of a key drought-resistance gene, leading to improved water-use efficiency (hypothetical abstract).  Similarly, \"CRISPR-Mediated Disease Resistance in Tomatoes\" explored the use of CRISPR to engineer resistance against a devastating fungal pathogen (hypothetical abstract).  The paper titled \"Improving Nutritional Content in Rice via CRISPR\" focused on enhancing the levels of essential vitamins and minerals in rice grains (hypothetical abstract).  Another study, \"CRISPR-Based Pest Resistance in Cotton,\" investigated the potential of CRISPR to create pest-resistant cotton varieties, reducing the need for harmful pesticides (hypothetical abstract). Finally, \"Genome-Wide CRISPR Screening for Herbicide Tolerance in Soybeans\" used a high-throughput CRISPR approach to identify genes responsible for herbicide sensitivity, potentially leading to the development of herbicide-tolerant soybean varieties (hypothetical abstract). These studies collectively demonstrate the vast potential of CRISPR technology to address critical challenges in agriculture and improve global food security.  Further research is needed to fully realize the potential benefits while carefully addressing ethical and regulatory considerations.\n",
