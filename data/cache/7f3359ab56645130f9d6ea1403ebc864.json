    "response": "The steps to get user data, combining user information and preferences, involve making two API calls and merging the results. Here's a breakdown, assuming you're using a language like Python with a library like `requests`:\n\n**1.  Make the initial user request:**\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\ndef get_user_data(user_id):\n    \"\"\"Retrieves user data and preferences.\"\"\"\n\n    user_url = f\"https://api.example.com/users/{user_id}\" # Replace with your API base URL\n\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(user_url)\n        response.raise_for_status() # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)\n        user_data = response.json()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching user data: {e}\")\n        return None  # Or handle the error appropriately, e.g., raise a custom exception\n\n    # Check if the user exists (assuming the API returns a 404 if the user isn't found)\n    if response.status_code == 404:\n        return None # Or return an appropriate error message\n\n    # Proceed to fetch preferences only if user data was successfully retrieved.\n    return fetch_and_combine_preferences(user_data, user_id)\n\n```\n\n**2. Fetch and combine preferences:**\n\n```python\ndef fetch_and_combine_preferences(user_data, user_id):\n    \"\"\"Fetches user preferences and merges them with user data.\"\"\"\n\n    preferences_url = f\"https://api.example.com/users/{user_id}/preferences\" # Replace with your API base URL\n\n    try:\n        preferences_response = requests.get(preferences_url)\n        preferences_response.raise_for_status()\n        preferences_data = preferences_response.json()\n\n        #Combine the data.  The method depends on your data structure.  Example below:\n        user_data[\"preferences\"] = preferences_data\n        return user_data\n\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching preferences: {e}\")\n        # Handle error -  options include:\n        # 1. Return user_data without preferences (partial data)\n        # 2. Return None\n        # 3. Raise an exception\n        return user_data # Returning user data without preferences in this example.\n\n\n# Example usage:\nuser_id = 123\ncombined_data = get_user_data(user_id)\n\nif combined_data:\n    print(json.dumps(combined_data, indent=2)) #Print the combined JSON data nicely formatted.\nelse:\n    print(\"User not found or error occurred.\")\n\n```\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Error Handling:**  The code includes basic error handling using `try...except` blocks.  More robust error handling might be needed for production systems (e.g., logging errors, retry mechanisms, different error responses based on HTTP status codes).\n* **API Rate Limits:**  Be mindful of API rate limits. If you're making many requests, you might need to implement rate limiting or caching mechanisms.\n* **Authentication:** If your API requires authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth), you'll need to include appropriate headers in your requests.\n* **Data Structure:** The `user_data[\"preferences\"] = preferences_data` line assumes a simple merging where preferences become a field within the user data. Adapt this based on the actual structure of your API responses. You might need to use more sophisticated merging techniques if there are overlapping keys or nested structures.\n* **Asynchronous Requests:** For improved performance, especially when dealing with many users, consider using asynchronous requests (e.g., `aiohttp` in Python) to make the API calls concurrently.\n\n\nRemember to replace `\"https://api.example.com/users/{user_id}\"` and `\"https://api.example.com/users/{user_id}/preferences\"` with the actual URLs of your API endpoints.  Also, adapt the error handling and data merging to fit your specific needs.\n",
