    "response": "Okay, let's solve this mathematical reasoning problem step-by-step.  Since you only provided \"Problem 1,\" I'll need you to provide the actual problem statement.  Please tell me the problem!\n\n**Once you give me the problem, I will:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** I'll read the problem carefully to identify what's being asked, what information is given, and any constraints.\n2.  **Devise a Plan:**  I'll determine the best approach to solve the problem. This might involve:\n    *   Identifying relevant mathematical concepts (e.g., arithmetic, algebra, geometry, logic).\n    *   Breaking the problem down into smaller, more manageable parts.\n    *   Choosing appropriate formulas or methods.\n3.  **Execute the Plan:** I'll perform the necessary calculations, logical steps, or constructions according to the plan.  I'll show my work clearly.\n4.  **Check the Solution:**  I'll verify the answer to make sure it's reasonable and that I haven't made any errors.  I might re-do calculations or use a different method to confirm the result.\n5.  **State the Answer:** I'll clearly state the final answer in the appropriate units or format.\n\n**Example (Waiting for your Problem):**\n\nLet's say you give me this problem:\n\n**Problem 1: What is 5 + 3?**\n\nHere's how I would solve it:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The problem asks for the sum of two numbers, 5 and 3.\n2.  **Devise a Plan:**  This is a simple addition problem.  I'll just add the two numbers together.\n3.  **Execute the Plan:** 5 + 3 = 8\n4.  **Check the Solution:**  I can count on my fingers or use a calculator to confirm that 5 + 3 = 8.\n5.  **State the Answer:** The answer is 8.\n\n**Now, please provide the actual \"Problem 1\" so I can help you!**\n",
