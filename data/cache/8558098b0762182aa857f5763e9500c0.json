    "prompt": "A user says: \"My router keeps dropping every few minutes.\" 1) Check a troubleshooting knowledge-base (assume KB returns two steps: \"Restart router,\" \"Check firmware version\"). 2) If neither fixes the problem, create a Jira ticket in project \"NETSUP\" via POST /jira/ticket with fields {\"project\": \"NETSUP\", \"description\": <user's description + attempted fixes>}.",
    "response": "Okay, I will follow the instructions provided.\n\n**1. Troubleshooting and Knowledge Base Lookup**\n\nThe user says: \"My router keeps dropping every few minutes.\"\n\n*   **KB Lookup:** Assume the troubleshooting knowledge base returns the following steps:\n    1.  \"Restart router\"\n    2.  \"Check firmware version\"\n\n**2. Implement the Troubleshooting Steps**\n\n*   **Step 1: Restart Router** (Assume this is performed, but doesn't fix the issue)\n*   **Step 2: Check Firmware Version** (Assume this is performed, and it also doesn't fix the issue)\n\n**3. Create Jira Ticket**\n\nSince neither troubleshooting step resolved the issue, I will create a Jira ticket.\n\n*   **API Endpoint:** `/jira/ticket`\n*   **HTTP Method:** `POST`\n*   **Project:** NETSUP\n*   **Fields:**\n    *   `project`: \"NETSUP\"\n    *   `description`: \"My router keeps dropping every few minutes.  Attempted fixes: Restarted router, Checked firmware version.\"\n\n**Simulated POST Request and Response (Illustrative)**\n\nI'll simulate the POST request and the expected response.  In a real implementation, this would interact with the Jira API.\n\n```\nPOST /jira/ticket HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"project\": \"NETSUP\",\n  \"description\": \"My router keeps dropping every few minutes. Attempted fixes: Restarted router, Checked firmware version.\"\n}\n```\n\n**Simulated Response (Successful)**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ticket_id\": \"NETSUP-123\",\n  \"status\": \"created\",\n  \"message\": \"Ticket created successfully.\"\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the process**\n\n1.  **User Input:** The process begins with the user's problem description.\n2.  **KB Lookup (Simulated):** The system (or the user guided by the system) consults a troubleshooting knowledge base.\n3.  **Troubleshooting Steps:** The identified steps are performed.\n4.  **Failure Condition:** If the initial troubleshooting steps fail, the system proceeds to create a Jira ticket.\n5.  **Ticket Creation:** The system constructs the necessary data for the Jira ticket, including the user's description and the troubleshooting attempts.\n6.  **API Call (Simulated):** The system (or the user guided by the system) sends a POST request to the `/jira/ticket` endpoint, passing the ticket details in JSON format.\n7.  **Response Handling (Simulated):** The system (or the user guided by the system) receives a response from the Jira API. In this example, the response indicates successful ticket creation.  The `ticket_id` would be used for tracking and future communication.\n\nThis completes the steps outlined in the prompt.\n",
