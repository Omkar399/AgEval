# AgEval Research Enhancement Plan - 2025

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic enhancements required to transform AgEval from a technical implementation into a research-grade AI evaluation framework suitable for publication in top-tier venues (ICLR, NeurIPS, ACL, EMNLP).

## üéØ Research Objectives

### Primary Research Questions
1. **How effective is multi-judge consensus versus single-judge evaluation in AI agent assessment?**
2. **Can self-evaluation and iterative improvement reduce evaluation bias and increase reliability?**
3. **What is the optimal balance between evaluation cost, reliability, and discriminative power?**
4. **How do task-agnostic metrics perform across different domains compared to task-specific metrics?**

### Novel Contributions
1. **Multi-Judge Consensus Framework** with bias calibration and inter-judge reliability analysis
2. **Self-Evaluation Loop** enabling agents to iteratively improve responses
3. **Task-Agnostic Universal Metrics** that adapt to different task types
4. **Comprehensive Reliability Analysis** with statistical validation
